# S-Path-Finder

## Overview
The Metro Shortest Path Finder is a Java-based application that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two metro stations in a simulated metro network. The application allows users to view a list of metro stations, display the metro map, and calculate the shortest distance between any two stations.


## Features
* **List of Metro Stations:** Displays a list of available metro stations.
* **Metro Map:** Shows the connections and distances between different metro stations.
* **Shortest Path Calculation:** Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between a source and destination station.


## Technologies Used
* Java
* Collections Framework (List, PriorityQueue)
* Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Getting Started

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rathore-nikhil/S-Path-Finder.git
    cd S-Path-Finder

2. **Compile the Java Program:** Make sure you have Java installed on your machine. Compile the program using:
   ```bash
   javac SPathFinder.java

3. **Run the Program:** Execute the program with:
   ```bash
   java SPathFinder

4. **Interact with the Application:**
* Choose an option from the menu:
 1. List of all stations
 2. Show the metro map
 3. Get the shortest path from source to destination
* Follow the prompts to enter the source and destination stations for path calculation.
